# Wallet Error Handling Solution

## Problem
The application was experiencing wallet connection errors from browser extensions, specifically:
```
Error: Error checking default wallet status: {}
at chrome-extension://hpclkefagolihohboafpheddmmgdffjm/pageProvider.js
```

## Root Cause
- Browser wallet extensions (like MetaMask) were trying to communicate with the dApp
- The application lacked proper error handling for wallet extension communication failures
- Multiple wallet connectors were potentially conflicting with each other

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Error Handler (`useWalletErrorHandler.ts`)
- Created a custom hook that catches wallet-related errors globally
- Handles both `unhandledrejection` and `error` events
- Prevents non-critical wallet extension errors from cluttering the console
- Logs warnings instead of errors for better debugging

### 2. Enhanced Wallet Configuration (`simpleWagmiConfig.tsx`)
- Added timeout configuration for connection attempts (10 seconds)
- Disabled multi-provider discovery to avoid conflicts
- Added retry configuration (3 retries with 1-second delay)
- Created robust connector factory with fallback mechanisms

### 3. Improved Wallet Connection Component (`WalletConnectionStatus.tsx`)
- Better error handling for connection failures
- Clear user feedback for different connection states
- Retry mechanisms for failed connections
- Graceful fallback when wallet extensions are unavailable

### 4. Application-Level Integration
- Integrated the error handler at the app level in `ScaffoldEthAppWithProviders.tsx`
- Replaced basic wallet status display with enhanced component
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates console error spam from wallet extensions
- ✅ Provides better user experience with clear error messages
- ✅ Maintains application stability when wallet extensions fail
- ✅ Improves debugging with structured error logging
- ✅ Adds retry mechanisms for transient connection issues

## Testing
The solution handles the following scenarios:
- Wallet extension communication failures
- Network connectivity issues
- User rejection of connection requests
- Extension not installed or disabled
- Multiple wallet extensions conflicting
